.SH DESCRIPTION
.B libIDL\-config\-2
is a tool that is used to determine the compiler and linker flags that
should be used to compile and link programs that use the
\fIlibIDL-2\fP library.  This script seems to be semi\-obsolete, and
may not work correctly on non\-Debian systems; you should probably use
"pkg-config libIDL-2.0" instead.

In most cases, you will use one (or both) of the options
\fB\-\-cflags\fP or \fB\-\-libs\fP (depending on whether you are
compiling or linking.

.SH OPTIONS
.B libIDL-config-2
accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of \fIlibrary\fP on the standard output.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print a usage summary.
.TP
.B \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link with the specified
\fIlibrary\fP.
.TP
.B \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program using
the specified \fIlibrary\fP.
.TP
.BI \-\-prefix =PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that \fIlibrary\fP
was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags and
\-\-libs options. This option is also used for the exec prefix
if \-\-exec\-prefix was not specified. This option must be specified
before any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
.TP
.BI \-\-exec\-prefix =PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec prefix that
\fIlibrary\fP was built with when computing the output for the \-\-cflags
and \-\-libs options.  This option must be specified before any
\-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
